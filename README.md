# Wren SemVer

__WIP__

_A package for constructing, comparing and matching Semantic Versions_

This library uses [Recto](https://github.com/BrianOtto/Recto), a string manipulation library, which is included as a git submodule. Ironically, the whole point of this `SemVer` package is to aid creation of a Wren package manager, which will be used to include `Recto` \#CircularDependencies
